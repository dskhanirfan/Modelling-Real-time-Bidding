Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is a way for advertisers to pay publishers to show ad impressions on their websites. In this context, an 'advertiser' can be anyone with a product to sell: a car company, a small e-commerce website etc. A 'publisher' can be anyone with a website: a newspaper, a blogger, Facebook, Google etc. An 'impression' is a single instance of a banner ad being shown on a web page. The term RTB is usually not applied to other ad formats such as text ads ads, or ads alongside Google search results or Facebook news feeds, as different technology is used to buy and sell those other formats. The word 'bidding' comes from the fact that the price of impressions is set via an auction mechanism, where the role of the auctioneer is played by an 'ad exchange' who mediates between advertisers and publishers. The term 'real-time' stems from the fact that advertisers bidding in the auction must specify the price they are willing to pay for each impression separately for each impression, and within a strict time-constraint: usually around one tenth of a second, so the auction can run as the web page on which the impression will be shown is loading.
